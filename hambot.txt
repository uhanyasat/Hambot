[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!
I am not throwing away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot!
I'ma get a scholarship to King's College
I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge!
I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin' to reach my goal. My power of speech: unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Ev'ry burden, ev'ry disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the—

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS]
A-L-E-X-A-N-D
E-R—we are—meant to be…

[HAMILTON]
A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me!

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS]
(He says in parentheses)

[HAMILTON]
Don't be shocked when your hist'ry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy

[HAMILTON & LAURENS]
And I am not throwing away
My shot (my shot)
I am not throwing away
My shot (my shot)
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
And I'm not throwing away my shot
[HAMILTON/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot!

[LAFAYETTE]
I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to 'onarchy?
'Onarchy? How you say, how you say, 'anarchy?'
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
With my—

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[MULLIGAN]
Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I'm joining the rebellion 'cause I know it's my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants!
I'm gonna take a—

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[AARON BURR]
How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a
Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten
Spot in the Caribbean by providence, impoverished, in squalor
Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?

[JOHN LAURENS]
The ten-dollar Founding Father without a father
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter
By being a self-starter
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter

[THOMAS JEFFERSON]
And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted
Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter

[JAMES MADISON]
Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain

[BURR]
Well, the word got around, they said, “This kid is insane, man”
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
“Get your education, don’t forget from whence you came, and
The world's gonna know your name. What’s your name, man?”

[ALEXANDER HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton
My name is Alexander Hamilton
And there's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait, just you wait...

[ELIZA HAMILTON]
When he was ten his father split, full of it, debt-ridden
Two years later, see Alex and his mother bed-ridden
Half-dead sittin' in their own sick, the scent thick

[FULL COMPANY EXCEPT HAMILTON (whispering)]
And Alex got better but his mother went quick

[GEORGE WASHINGTON & COMPANY, BOTH]
Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide
Left him with nothin' but ruined pride, something new inside
A voice saying
“Alex, you gotta fend for yourself.”
He started retreatin' and readin' every treatise on the shelf

[BURR & COMPANY, BOTH]
There would have been nothin’ left to do
For someone less astute
He woulda been dead or destitute
Without a cent of restitution
Started workin', clerkin' for his late mother's landlord
Tradin’ sugar cane and rum and all the things he can’t afford
Scammin' for every book he can get his hands on
Plannin' for the future see him now as he stands on (ooh)
The bow of a ship headed for a new land
In New York you can be a new man

[COMPANY & HAMILTON, WOMEN, MEN]
In New York you can be a new man (Just you wait)
In New York you can be a new man (Just you wait)
In New York you can be a new man
In New York, New York
Just you wait!

[COMPANY]
Alexander Hamilton (Alexander Hamilton)
We are waiting in the wings for you (waiting in the wings for you)
You could never back down
You never learned to take your time!
Oh, Alexander Hamilton (Alexander Hamilton)
When America sings for you
Will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote the game?
The world will never be the same, oh

[BURR, MEN, & COMPANY]
The ship is in the harbor now
See if you can spot him
Just you wait
Another immigrant
Comin’ up from the bottom
Just you wait
His enemies destroyed his rep
America forgot him

[MULLIGAN/MADISON & LAFAYETTE/JEFFERSON]
We fought with him

[LAURENS/PHILIP]
Me? I died for him

[WASHINGTON]
Me? I trusted him

[ELIZA & ANGELICA & PEGGY/MARIA]
Me? I loved him

[BURR]
And me? I'm the damn fool that shot him

[COMPANY]
There's a million things I haven’t done
But just you wait!

[BURR]
What's your name, man?



[COMPANY]
Alexander Hamilton!

[COMPANY]
1776. New York City

[HAMILTON]
Pardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir?

[BURR]
That depends. Who’s asking?

[HAMILTON]
Oh, well, sure, sir
I’m Alexander Hamilton, I’m at your service, sir
I have been looking for you

[BURR]
I’m getting nervous

[HAMILTON]
Sir…
I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. It’s a blur, sir. He handles the financials?

[BURR]
You punched the bursar

[HAMILTON]
Yes!
I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, I’m not stupid

So how’d you do it? How’d you graduate so fast?

[BURR]
It was my parents’ dying wish before they passed

[HAMILTON]
You’re an orphan. Of course! I’m an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we’re worth more
Than anyone bargained for…

[BURR]
Can I buy you a drink?

[HAMILTON]
That would be nice

[BURR]
While we’re talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less

[HAMILTON]
What?

[BURR]
Smile more

[HAMILTON]
Ha

[BURR]
Don’t let them know what you’re against or what you’re for

[HAMILTON]
You can’t be serious

[BURR]
You wanna get ahead?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[BURR]
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead

[LAURENS]
Yo yo yo yo yo!
What time is it?

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Show time!

[BURR]
Like I said…

[LAURENS]
Show time! Show time! Yo!
I’m John Laurens in the place to be!
Two pints o’ Sam Adams, but I’m workin’ on three, uh!
Those redcoats don’t want it with me!
Cuz I will pop chick-a pop these cops till I’m free!

[LAFAYETTE]
Oui oui, mon ami, je m’appelle Lafayette!
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say “Bonsoir!”
Tell the King “Casse toi!” Who’s the best?
C’est moi!

[MULLIGAN]
Brrrah brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin’ it, yes I heard ya mother said “Come again?”

[LAFAYETTE & LAURENS]
Ayyyyy

[MULLIGAN]
Lock up ya daughters and horses, of course
It’s hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets…

[LAFAYETTE]
Wow

[LAURENS]
No more sex, pour me another brew, son!
Let’s raise a couple more…

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
To the revolution!

[LAURENS]
Well, if it ain’t the prodigy of Princeton college!

[MULLIGAN]
Aaron Burr!

[LAURENS]
Give us a verse, drop some knowledge!

[BURR]
Good luck with that: you’re takin’ a stand
You spit. I’m ‘a sit. We’ll see where we land

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Boooo!

[LAURENS]
Burr, the revolution’s imminent. What do you stall for?

[HAMILTON]
If you stand for nothing, Burr, what’ll you fall for?

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS]
Ooh
Who you?
Who you?
Who are you?

[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS]
Ooh, who is this kid? What’s he gonna do?

[Verse 1: KING GEORGE]
You say
The price of my love’s not a price that you’re willing to pay
You cry
In your tea which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by
Why so sad?
Remember we made an arrangement when you went away
Now you’re making me mad
Remember, despite our estrangement, I’m your man
You’ll be back, soon you’ll see
You’ll remember you belong to me
You’ll be back, time will tell
You’ll remember that I served you well
Oceans rise, empires fall
We have seen each other through it all
And when push comes to shove
I will send a fully armed battalion to remind you of my love!

[Chorus: KING GEORGE ]
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da…

[Verse 2: KING GEORGE]
You say our love is draining and you can’t go on
You’ll be the one complaining when I am gone...
And no, don’t change the subject
Cuz you’re my favorite subject
My sweet, submissive subject
My loyal, royal subject
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever…

[HAMILTON/BURR/LAURENS/ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]
Hey hey hey hey

[ELIZA]
Ohh, I do I do I do I
Hey hey hey hey
Dooo! Hey!
Hey hey hey hey
Ohh, I do I do I do I
Hey hey hey hey
Dooo! Boy you got me
Hey hey hey hey

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Helpless!
Look into your eyes, and the sky’s the limit I’m helpless!
Down for the count, and I’m drownin’ in ‘em

[ELIZA]
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin’ at my sister as she’s dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went “Boom!”
Tryin’ to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody’s dancin’ and the band’s top volume

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine

[ELIZA & ALL WOMEN]
Grab my sister, and whisper, “Yo, this one’s mine.” (Ooh)
My sister made her way across the room to you (Ooh)
And I got nervous, thinking “What’s she gonna do?” (Ooh)
She grabbed you by the arm, I’m thinkin’ “I’m through” (Ooh)
Then you look back at me and suddenly I’m
Helpless!
Oh, look at those eyes
Look into your eyes
And the sky's the limit
Oh!
I'm helpless
Yeah, I'm helpless, I know
Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em
I'm helpless
I'm so into you
Look into your eyes
I am so into you
And the sky's the limit, I'm helpless
I know I'm down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em
Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I’m about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It’s a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I’ll leave you to it

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
One week later

[ELIZA]
I’m writin’ a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin’ at my sister, cuz she wants to form a harem

[ANGELICA]
I’m just sayin’, if you really loved me, you would share him

[ELIZA & ALL WOMEN]
Ha!
Two weeks later in the living room stressin’ (stressin')
My father’s stone-faced while you’re asking for his blessin’ (blessin')
I’m dying inside, as you wine and dine
And I’m tryin’ not to cry ‘cause there’s nothing that your mind can’t do (Ooh)
My father makes his way across the room to you (Ooh)
I panic for a second, thinking “we’re through”(Ooh)
But then he shakes your hand and says “Be true” (Ooh)
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I’m
Helpless! (Helpless!)
Look into your eyes and the sky's the limit
I'm helpless
Helpless
Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em (hoo!)
I'm helpless!
That boy is mine, that boy is mine
Look into your eyes and the sky's the limit
I'm helpless
Helpless, helpless
Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em
Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em

[HAMILTON]
Eliza, I don’t have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have’s my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We’ll get a little place in Harlem and we’ll figure it out
I’ve been livin’ without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I’ll never forget my mother’s face, that was real
And long as I’m alive, Eliza, swear to God
You’ll never feel so…

[ALL WOMEN, ELIZA, & HAMILTON]
Helpless!
I do, I do, I do, I do!
Eliza
Helpless!
I do, I do, I do, I do!
I've never felt so—
Helpless!
Hey, yeah, yeah!
Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em
I'm down for the count, I'm—
Helpless!
My life is gon' be fine 'cause Eliza's in it
Helpless!
I look into your eyes and the sky's the limit, I'm—
Helpless!
Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em
...drownin' in 'em

[ALL WOMEN]
In New York, you can be a new man…
In New York, you can be a new man…
In New York, you can be a new man…

[ELIZA]
Helpless

Ladies and gentlemen, you could have been anywhere in the world tonight
But you're here with us in New York City
Are you ready for a cabinet meeting, huh?
The issue on the table, Secretary Hamilton's plan to assume state debt and establish a national bank
Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor, sir
Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness
We fought for these ideals, we shouldn't settle for less
These are wise words, enterprising men quote 'em
Don't act surprised, you guys, 'cause I wrote 'em (ow)
But Hamilton forgets
His plan would have the government assume state's debts
Now, place your bets as to who that benefits
The very seat of government where Hamilton sits
Oh, if the shoe fits, wear it
If New York's in debt, why should Virginia bear it?
Uh, our debts are paid, I'm afraid
Don't tax the South 'cause we got it made in the shade
In Virginia, we plant seeds in the ground
We create, you just wanna move our money around
This financial plan is an outrageous demand
And it's too many damn pages for any man to understand
Stand with me in the land of the free and pray to God we never see Hamilton's candidacy
Look, when Britain taxed our tea, we got frisky
Imagine what gon' happen when you try to tax our whisky
Thank you, Secretary Jefferson
Secretary Hamilton, your response
Thomas, that was a real nice declaration
Welcome to the present, we're running a real nation
Would you like to join us, or stay mellow
Doin' whatever the hell it is you do in Monticello?
If we assume the debts, the union gets new line of credit, a financial diuretic
How do you not get it, if we're aggressive and competitive
The union gets a boost, you'd rather give it a sedative?
A civics lesson from a slaver, hey neighbor
Your debts are paid 'cause you don't pay for labor
"We plant seeds in the South. We create." Yeah, keep ranting
We know who's really doing the planting
And another thing, Mr. Age of Enlightenment
Don't lecture me about the war, you didn't fight in it
You think I'm frightened of you, man?
We almost died in a trench
While you were off getting high with the French
Thomas Jefferson, always hesitant with the President
Reticent there isn't a plan he doesn't jettison
Madison, you're mad as a hatter, son, take your medicine
Damn, you're in worse shape than the national debt is in
Sittin' there useless as two shits
Hey, turn around, bend over, I'll show you where my shoe fits
Excuse me, Madison, Jefferson, take a walk
Hamilton, take a walk, we're gonna reconvene after a brief recess, Hamilton
Sir
A word
You don't have the votes (you don't have the votes)
Aha-ha-ha ha
You're gonna need congressional approval and you don't have the votes
Such a blunder sometimes it makes me wonder why I even bring the thunder
Why he even brings the thunder
You wanna pull yourself together?
I'm sorry, these Virginians are birds of a feather
Young man, I'm from Virginia, so watch your mouth
So we let Congress get held hostage by the South?
You need the votes
No, we need bold strokes, we need this plan (no, you need to convince more folks)
James Madison won't talk to me, that's a nonstarter
Ah, winning was easy, young man, governing's harder
They're being intransigent
You have to find a compromise
But they don't have a plan, they just hate mine (convince them otherwise)
And what happens if I don't get congressional approval?
I imagine they'll call for your removal
Sir
Figure it out, Alexander, that's an order from your commander

[ELIZA]
Stay alive…

[ELIZA/ANGELICA/ENSEMBLE WOMEN]
Stay alive…

[HAMILTON]
I have never seen the General so despondent
I have taken over writing all his correspondence
Congress writes, “George, attack the British forces.”
I shoot back, we have resorted to eating our horses
Local merchants deny us equipment, assistance
They only take British money, so sing a song of sixpence

[WASHINGTON]
The cavalry’s not coming

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Alex, listen. There’s only one way for us to win this
Provoke outrage, outright

[HAMILTON]
That’s right

[WASHINGTON]
Don’t engage, strike by night
Remain relentless ‘til their troops take flight

[HAMILTON]
Make it impossible to justify the cost of the fight

[WASHINGTON]
Outrun

[HAMILTON]
Outrun

[WASHINGTON]
Outlast

[HAMILTON]
Outlast

[WASHINGTON]
Hit ‘em quick, get out fast

[HAMILTON]
Chick-a-plao!

[WASHINGTON]
Stay alive ‘til this horror show is past
We’re gonna fly a lot of flags half-mast

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass!

[MULLIGAN]
I go back to New York and my apprenticeship

[LAFAYETTE]
I ask for French aid, I pray that France has sent a ship

[LAURENS]
I stay at work with Hamilton
We write essays against slavery
And every day’s a test of our camaraderie
And bravery

[HAMILTON]
We cut supply lines, we steal contraband
We pick and choose our battles and places to take a stand
And ev’ry day
“Sir, entrust me with a command,”
And ev’ry day

[WASHINGTON]
No

[HAMILTON]
He dismisses me out of hand

[HAMILTON]
Instead of me
He promotes
Charles Lee
Makes him second-in-command:

[LEE]
Charles Lee. [ELIZA/ANGELICA]
Stay alive...

[LEE]
I’m a General. Whee!!!!

[HAMILTON]
Yeah. He’s not the choice I would have gone with

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
He shits the bed at the Battle of Monmouth

[WASHINGTON]
Ev’ryone attack!

[LEE]
Retreat!

[WASHINGTON]
Attack!

[LEE]
Retreat!

[WASHINGTON]
What are you doing, Lee? Get back on your feet!

[LEE]
But there’s so many of them!

[WASHINGTON]
I’m sorry, is this not your speed?!
Hamilton!

[HAMILTON]
Ready, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Have Lafayette take the lead!

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir!

[LAURENS]
A thousand soldiers die in a hundred degree heat

[LAFAYETTE]
As we snatch a stalemate from the jaws of defeat

[HAMILTON]
Charles Lee was left behind
Without a pot to piss in
He started sayin’ this to anybody who would listen:

[LEE]
Washington cannot be left alone to his devices
Indecisive, from crisis to crisis
The best thing he can do for the revolution
Is turn n’ go back to plantin’ tobacco in Mount Vernon

[COMPANY]
Oo!!

[WASHINGTON]
Don’t do a thing. History will prove him wrong

[HAMILTON]
But, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
We have a war to fight, let’s move along

[LAURENS]
Strong words from Lee, someone oughta hold him to it
I was younger than you are now
When I was given my first command
I led my men straight into a massacre
I witnessed their deaths firsthand
I made every mistake
I felt the shame rise in me
And even now I lie awake

[WASHINGTON]
Knowing history has its eyes on me



[HAMILTON/WASHINGTON]
History has its eyes on me. [LAURENS/MULLIGAN]
Whoa…
Whoa…
Whoa…
Yeah

[COMPANY]
Whoa…
Whoa…
Whoa…
Yeah

[WASHINGTON]
Let me tell you what I wish I’d known
When I was young and dreamed of glory:
You have no control:

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Who lives, who dies, who tells your story

[WASHINGTON]
I know that we can win
I know that greatness lies in you
But remember from here on in

[WASHINGTON/HAMILTON AND MEN]
History has its
Eyes on you.

[ENSEMBLE]
Whoa…
Whoa…
Whoa…
[FULL COMPANY]
History has its eyes on you
[HAMILTON]
I can’t disobey direct orders

[LAURENS]
Then I’ll do it
Alexander, you’re the closest friend I’ve got

[HAMILTON]
Laurens, do not throw away your shot

[KING GEORGE]
They say
The price of my war’s not a price that they’re willing to pay
Insane
You cheat with the French, now I’m fighting with France and with Spain
I’m so blue
I thought that we’d made an arrangement
When you went away
You were mine to subdue
Well, even despite our estrangement, I’ve got
A small query for you:

What comes next?
You’ve been freed
Do you know how hard it is to lead?

You’re on your own
Awesome. Wow
Do you have a clue what happens now?

Oceans rise
Empires fall
It’s much harder when it’s all your call

All alone, across the sea
When your people say they hate you, don’t
Come crawling back to me

Da da da dat da dat da da da
Da ya da
Da da dat
Da da ya da...

You’re on your own

[COMPANY]
Seventeen. Se- se- seventeen...
Se- se- seventeen…

[BURR]
1789
How does the bastard orphan
Immigrant decorated war vet
Unite the colonies through more debt?
Fight the other founding fathers til he has to forfeit?
Have it all, lose it all
You ready for more yet?
Treasury Secretary. Washington’s the President
Ev’ry American experiment sets a precedent
Not so fast. Someone came along to resist him
Pissed him off until we had a two-party system
You haven’t met him yet, you haven’t had the chance
‘cause he’s been kickin’ ass as the ambassador to France
But someone’s gotta keep the American promise
You simply must meet Thomas. Thomas!

[COMPANY]
Thomas Jefferson’s coming home!
Thomas Jefferson’s coming home!
Thomas Jefferson’s coming home!
Thomas Jefferson’s coming home!
Thomas Jefferson’s coming home Lord he’s
Been off in Paris for so long!
Aaa-ooo!
Aaa-ooo!

[JEFFERSON]
France is following us to revolution
There is no more status quo
But the sun comes up and the world still spins

[ENSEMBLE]
Aaa-ooo!

[JEFFERSON]
I helped Lafayette draft a declaration
Then I said, ‘I gotta go
I gotta be in Monticello.’ Now the work at
Home begins…

[ENSEMBLE]
Aaa-ooo!

[JEFFERSON]
So what’d I miss?
What’d I miss?
Virginia, my home sweet home, I wanna give you a kiss
I’ve been in Paris meeting lots of different ladies...
I guess I basic’lly missed the late eighties...
I traveled the wide, wide world and came back to this…

[ENSEMBLE]
Aaa-ooo!

[JEFFERSON]
There’s a letter on my desk from the President
Haven’t even put my bags down yet
Sally be a lamb, darlin’, won’tcha open it?
It says the President’s assembling a cabinet
And that I am to be the Secretary of State, great!
And that I’m already Senate-approved...
I just got home and now I’m headed up to New York

[ENSEMBLE]
Headin’ to New York!
Headin’ to New York!

[JEFFERSON]
Lookin’ at the rolling fields
I can’t believe that we are free

Ready to face
Whatever’s awaiting
Me in N.Y.C.
[ENSEMBLE]
Believe that we are free



Me in N.Y.C.

[JEFFERSON]
But who’s waitin’ for me when I step in the place?
My friend James Madison, red in the face

[JEFFERSON]
He grabs my arm and
I respond
“What’s goin’ on?”


[ENSEMBLE]
Aaa-ooo!

[MADISON]
Thomas, we are engaged in a battle for our nation’s very soul
Can you get us out of the mess we’re in?

[ENSEMBLE]
Aaa-ooo!

[MADISON]
Hamilton’s new financial plan is nothing less
Than government control
I’ve been fighting for the South alone
Where have you been?



[ENSEMBLE]
Aaa-ooo! [JEFFERSON]
Uh...France.

[MADISON]
We have to win

[JEFFERSON]
What’d I miss?

What’d I miss?

Headfirst into a political abyss!

I have my first cabinet meeting today

I guess I better think of something to say
I’m already on my way
Let’s get to the bottom of this…
[ENSEMBLE]
Wha? Wha? What’d I miss?

I’ve come home to this?

Headfirst, into the abyss!


Chik-a-pow!


On my way

What did I miss?
Ahhh ah!

[WASHINGTON]
Mr. Jefferson, welcome home

[HAMILTON]
Mr. Jefferson? Alexander Hamilton

[WASHINGTON AND ENSEMBLE]
Mr. Jefferson, welcome home

[COMPANY]
Mr. Jefferson, welcome home
Sir, you’ve been off in Paris for so long!

[JEFFERSON]
So what did I miss?


[FULL COMPANY]
The election of 1800

[JEFFERSON]
Can we get back to politics?

[MADISON]
Please?

[JEFFERSON]
Yo. Ev’ry action has an equal, opposite reaction
John Adams shat the bed. I love the guy, but he’s in traction
Poor Alexander Hamilton? He is missing in action
So now I’m facing—

[JEFFERSON AND MADISON]
Aaron Burr!

[JEFFERSON]
With his own faction

[MADISON]
He’s very attractive in the North. New Yorkers like his chances

[JEFFERSON]
He’s not very forthcoming on any particular stances

[MADISON]
Ask him a question: it glances off, he obfuscates, he dances

[JEFFERSON]
And they say I’m a Francophile: at least they know I know where France is!

[MADISON]
Thomas that’s the problem, see, they see Burr as a less extreme you

[JEFFERSON]
Ha!

[MADISON]
You need to change course, a key endorsement might redeem you

[JEFFERSON]
Who did you have in mind?

[MADISON]
Don’t laugh

[JEFFERSON]
Who is it?

[MADISON]
You used to work on the same staff

[JEFFERSON]
Whaaaat

[MADISON]
It might be nice, it might be nice
To get Hamilton on your side

[JEFFERSON AND MADISON]
It might be nice, it might be nice
To get Hamilton on your side

[BURR]
Talk less!

Smile more!

Don’t let ‘em know what you’re against or what you’re for!

Shake hands with him!

Charm her!

It’s eighteen hundred, ladies, tell your husbands: vote for
Burr!
[ENSEMBLE]
Burr!

Burr!


Burr!

Burr!

Burr!


Burr!

[MALE VOTER]
I don’t like Adams

[FEMALE VOTER]
Well, he’s gonna lose, that’s just defeatist

[ANOTHER MALE VOTER]
And Jefferson—

[TWO MEN]
In love with France!

[ANOTHER FEMALE VOTER]
Yeah, he’s so elitist!

[TWO WOMEN]
I like that Aaron Burr!

[A WOMAN]
I can’t believe we’re here with him!

[A MAN]
He seems approachable…?

[ANOTHER MALE VOTER]
Like you could grab a beer with him!

[ENSEMBLE]
Dear Mr. Hamilton: your fellow Fed’ralists would like to know how you’ll be voting

[HAMILTON]
It’s quiet uptown

[ENSEMBLE]

[HAMILTON]

[WOMEN]

[BURR]

[HAMILTON]
You’ve created quite a stir, sir!

[BURR]
I’m going door to door!

[HAMILTON]
You’re openly campaigning?

[BURR]
Sure!

[HAMILTON]
That’s new

[BURR]
Honestly, it’s kind of draining

[HAMILTON]
Burr—

[BURR]
Sir!

[HAMILTON]
Is there anything you wouldn’t do?

[BURR]
No. I’m chasing what I want
And you know what?

[HAMILTON]
What?

[BURR]
I learned that from you

[ENSEMBLE]
If you had to choose
If you had to choose

[MADISON]
It’s a tie!

[ENSEMBLE]
If you had to choose

[JEFFERSON]

[ENSEMBLE]
Oh!

[HAMILTON]
For the country is facing a difficult choice

[ENSEMBLE]
Oh!

[HAMILTON]
And if you were to ask me who I’d promote—

[ENSEMBLE]
Oh!

[HAMILTON]
—Jefferson has my vote

[JEFFERSON/MADISON/ENSEMBLE]
Oh!

[HAMILTON]
I have never agreed with Jefferson once

[JEFFERSON/MADISON/ENSEMBLE]
Oh!

[HAMILTON]
We have fought on like seventy-five diff’rent fronts

[JEFFERSON/MADISON/ENSEMBLE]
Oh!

[HAMILTON]
But when all is said and all is done
Jefferson has beliefs. Burr has none

[ENSEMBLE]
Oooooooooooooh

[MADISON AND JEFFERSON]
Well, I’ll be damned
Well, I’ll be damned

[MADISON]
Hamilton’s on your side

[ENSEMBLE]
Well, I’ll be damned
Well, I’ll be damned

[JEFFERSON]
And?

[MADISON]
You won in a landslide

[BURR]
Congrats on a race well-run
I did give you a fight

[JEFFERSON]
Uh-huh

[BURR]
I look forward to our partnership

[JEFFERSON]
Our partnership?

[BURR]
As your vice-President

[JEFFERSON]
Ha. Yeah, right
You hear this guy? Man openly campaigns against me, talkin’ bout, “I look forward to our partnership.”

[MADISON]
It’s crazy that the guy who comes in second becomes vice President

[JEFFERSON]
Yeah, you know what? We can change that. You know why?

[MADISON]
Why?

[JEFFERSON]
‘cuz I’m the President. Hey, Burr, when you see Hamilton, thank him for the endorsement

[MALE COMPANY]
One two three four

[FULL COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON AND BURR)]
Five six seven eight nine—

[BURR]
There are ten things you need to know

[COMPANY]
Number one!

[BURR]
We rowed across the Hudson at dawn
My friend, William P. Van Ness signed on as my—

[BURR AND COMPANY]
Number two!

[BURR]
Hamilton arrived with his crew:
Nathaniel Pendleton and a doctor that he knew

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[BURR]
I watched Hamilton examine the terrain
I wish I could tell you what was happ’ning in his brain
This man has poisoned my political pursuits!

[COMPANY]
Most disputes die and no one shoots!
Number four!

[BURR]
Hamilton drew first position
Looking, to the world, like a man on a mission
This is a soldier with a marksman’s ability
The doctor turned around so he could have deniability

COMPANY
Five!

BURR
Now I didn’t know this at the time
But we were—

[BURR AND PHILIP]
Near the same spot
Your son died, is that
Why— [HAMILTON]
Near the same spot
My son died, is that
Why—

[COMPANY]
Six!

[BURR]
He examined his gun with such rigor?
I watched as he methodically fiddled with the trigger

[COMPANY]
Seven!

[BURR]
Confession time? Here’s what I got:
My fellow soldiers’ll tell you I’m a terrible shot

[COMPANY]
Number eight!

[BURR/HAMILTON/ENSEMBLE MEN]
Your last chance to negotiate
Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight

[BURR]
They won’t teach you this in your classes
But look it up, Hamilton was wearing his glasses
Why? If not to take deadly aim?
It’s him or me, the world will never be the same
I had only one thought before the slaughter:
This man will not make an orphan of my daughter

[COMPANY]
Number nine!

[BURR]
Look him in the eye, aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require
Then count:

[COMPANY]
One two three four five six seven eight nine
Number ten paces! Fire!—

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
Is this where it gets me, on my feet, sev’ral feet ahead of me?
I see it coming, do I run or fire my gun or let it be?
There is no beat, no melody
Burr, my first friend, my enemy
Maybe the last face I ever see
If I throw away my shot, is this how you’ll remember me?
What if this bullet is my legacy?

Legacy. What is a legacy?
It’s planting seeds in a garden you never get to see
I wrote some notes at the beginning of a song someone will sing for me
America, you great unfinished symphony, you sent for me
You let me make a difference
A place where even orphan immigrants
Can leave their fingerprints and rise up
I’m running out of time. I’m running, and my time’s up
Wise up. Eyes up
I catch a glimpse of the other side
Laurens leads a soldiers’ chorus on the other side
My son is on the other side
He’s with my mother on the other side
Washington is watching from the other side

Teach me how to say goodbye

Rise up, rise up, rise up
Eliza

My love, take your time
I’ll see you on the other side
Raise a glass to freedom...

[BURR AND COMPANY]
He aims his pistol at the sky—

[BURR]
Wait!

[BURR]
I strike him right between his ribs
I walk towards him, but I am ushered away
They row him back across the Hudson
I get a drink

[COMPANY]
Aaaah
Aaaah
Aaaah

[BURR]
I hear wailing in the streets

[COMPANY]
Aaaah
Aaaah
Aaaah

[BURR]
Somebody tells me, “You’d better hide.”

[COMPANY]
Aaaah
Aaaah
Aaaah

[BURR]
They say

[BURR AND ANGELICA]
Angelica and Eliza—

[BURR]
Were both at his side when he died
Death doesn’t discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
History obliterates
In every picture it paints
It paints me and all my mistakes
When Alexander aimed
At the sky
He may have been the first one to die
But I’m the one who paid for it

I survived, but I paid for it

Now I’m the villain in your history
I was too young and blind to see...
I should’ve known
I should’ve known
The world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me
The world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me
